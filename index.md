# 📘 NLP Basics: A Quick Reference

## 🎯 Objective
This project is a concise documentation and hands-on guide to understanding the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It focuses on the preprocessing phase — the cornerstone of any NLP pipeline.

---

## 🧹 Core Concepts Covered

- **Text Cleaning**
- **Removing punctuation and special characters**
- **Lowercasing text**
- **Tokenization**
  - Splitting sentences into words (tokens)
- **Stopword Removal**
  - Removing common English words that add little value (e.g., *the, and, is*)
- **Lemmatization**
  - Converting words to their base/root form (e.g., *running → run*)
- **Corpus Building**
  - Creating cleaned, structured data ready for modeling

---

## ⚠️ Common Hurdles in NLP

- Encoding issues with non-ASCII characters
- Over-removal of useful words during stopword filtering
- Lemmatization inconsistencies (e.g., lack of context for POS tagging)
- Memory errors for large text corpora
- Library-related typos (e.g., `stopwords.word()` vs `stopwords.words()`)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/) – Natural Language Toolkit for stopwords, lemmatization
- [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) – Regular expressions for text cleaning
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – Handling text in tabular format (`DataFrame`)
- [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) (optional) – For feature extraction like **TF-IDF**
