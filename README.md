# ðŸ§  All About NLP â€“ Feature Engineering & Term Analysis

Welcome to my NLP research and experimentation space. This repository documents key steps taken to process and analyze natural language data using common feature engineering techniques.

## âœ… Work Done So Far

I have:
- Applied **lemmatization** to normalize tokens
- Removed **stopwords** and **punctuation** to clean the text
- Used **CountVectorizer** to extract word-level features
- Performed **TF-IDF with n-grams** (unigrams, bigrams) to understand frequent and meaningful semantic terms

These steps help surface the most informative patterns in the dataset and prepare the text for downstream modeling.
