# ðŸ§  All About NLP â€“ Feature Engineering & Term Analysis

Welcome to my NLP research and experimentation space.

My journey into Natural Language Processing began in 2022 while exploring data science concepts. This repository documents the key steps I've taken to process and analyze text data using practical, interview-relevant feature engineering techniques.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this repo is not just to support my own learning, but to serve as a reference point for anyone preparing for NLP interviews. If you're reviewing core topics or looking for clean, example-driven notebooks â€” this space is built for you.

## âœ… Work Done So Far

I have:
- Applied **lemmatization** to normalize tokens
- Removed **stopwords** and **punctuation** to clean the text
- Used **CountVectorizer** to extract word-level features
- Performed **TF-IDF with n-grams** (unigrams, bigrams) to understand frequent and meaningful semantic terms

These steps help surface the most informative patterns in the dataset and prepare the text for downstream modeling.
